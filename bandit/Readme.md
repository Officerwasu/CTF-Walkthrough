# Bandit  
## Level 0

#### Level Goal

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

#### Solution

#### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command ‚Äúmktemp -d‚Äù. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

#### Solution

okay that was really difficult üò≠

## Level 13-14

#### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don‚Äôt get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

## Level 15-16

#### Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

Helpful note: Getting ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù, ‚ÄúRENEGOTIATING‚Äù or ‚ÄúKEYUPDATE‚Äù? Read the ‚ÄúCONNECTED COMMANDS‚Äù section in the manpage.

`kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx`

## Level 16-17

#### Level Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don‚Äôt. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Helpful note: Getting ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù, ‚ÄúRENEGOTIATING‚Äù or ‚ÄúKEYUPDATE‚Äù? Read the ‚ÄúCONNECTED COMMANDS‚Äù section in the manpage.

password `cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8`

## Level 19-20

#### Level Goal

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

#### Solution

password `0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO`

## Level 20-21

#### Level Goal

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

password `tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q`

## Level 22-23

#### Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

## Level 23-24

#### Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around‚Ä¶

password `gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8`

## Level 24-25

#### Level Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time.

password `iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4`

## Level 25-26

#### Level Goal

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy‚Ä¶ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

NOTE: if you‚Äôre a Windows user and typically use Powershell to ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.

#### Solution
okay so we got the ssh private key but it was not logging in bash insted it was laoding in somthing called showtext

password `s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ`


**Now accesesing this is really difficult** 
you will need to use vim inside of more and set the shell to /bin/bash after that you will be able to access it
